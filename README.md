# ReadMe-Creator
This homework is my first backend project. It creates a read me from the terminal. I practiced having a separate java page do the computation. I also became better with using external require add ons, along with connecting code with .then. This project was also one of the more complicated uses of a function, which helped me further stregnthen my understanding of them. The read me generator is useful because it allows for an easy and seemless way to create a ReadMe, arguably the worst part of programming. 

## Instructions
The terminal will pull of questions about the program you are creating, and one you answer, it will Create a new Read Me.
